## General Information
- General Info: Analysis is being done for a consumer finance company which specialises in lending various types of loans to urban customers.
- Project Background: When the company receives a loan application, the company has to make a decision for loan approval based on the applicant’s profile.The data shared contains information about past loan applicants and whether they ‘defaulted’ or not. The aim is to identify patterns which indicate if a person is likely to default, which may be used for taking actions such as denying the loan, reducing the amount of loan, lending (to risky applicants) at a higher interest rate, etc.
- Business problem trying to solve: Use EDA to understand how "consumer & loan attributes" influence the tendency of default. 
- Data being used is loan.csv (raw file contains 111 columns and 39,717 rows)


## Conclusions
- Conclusion 1 from the analysis: Giving loans for Small Business, Renewable Energy & Education especially for 60-month term is riskier. Might want to look for lower loan amount and lower term
- Conclusion 2 from the analysis: Giving loans where revol_util is high is risky, especially for larger loans.
- Conclusion 3 from the analysis: The highest loans issued are for those who live on rent but charge off is highest for ‘Others’. Need to be able to classify ‘Others’ better
- Conclusion 4 from the analysis: Higher charge-off rates are observed as the grade declines and int_rates increase
- Conclusion 5 from the analysis: Higher charge-off rates are seen among loans where interest rate increases and loan amount decreases. One might want to avoid such loans. People accepting high-interest but small-ticket loans are riskier.
